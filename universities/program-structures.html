            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Whatever structure a university chooses, certain design principles can help ensure AI governance learning
              remains robust, credible and responsive to change. These principles apply regardless of whether a
              professional institute is involved.

                <p class="text-muted small mb-0">
                  Program structures should emphasize governance, accountability and institutional context,
                  while staying grounded in an up-to-date understanding of AI technologies. This balance helps
                  learners distinguish between transient tools and durable governance responsibilities.

                <p class="text-muted small mb-0">
                  Well-designed structures expose learners to multiple perspectives: regulators, organizations,
                  civil society and affected communities. Professional institutes can contribute practice-oriented
                  viewpoints, but should not dominate the discourse or replace academic critique and debate.

                  AI governance will evolve. Program structures should be designed so that modules, cases and
                  pathways can be updated without destabilizing degrees or violating accreditation commitments.
                  External reference points can help inform revisions, but changes must follow institutional
                  processes and regulatory guidance.

          These principles are generic and non-exhaustive. Each institution will interpret them in light of its own
          mission, values, obligations and external environment.
