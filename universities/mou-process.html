            <p class="section-subtitle">
              While each university has its own procedures, many partnership journeys follow a similar
              pattern: initial interest, conceptual alignment, drafting, internal approvals, signing,
              implementation and periodic review. As AI governance becomes more central to institutional
              strategy, these phases may increasingly include explicit risk, ethics and digital governance
              checkpoints.

                <p class="card-text text-muted small mb-0">
                  Initial conversations often begin with academic or leadership interest in themes such as
                  AI governance, digital ethics or responsible AI. These discussions explore whether
                  collaboration aligns with institutional mission, values and regulatory context before
                  any documentation is drafted or announced publicly.

                <p class="card-text text-muted small mb-0">
                  Once there is conceptual alignment, many institutions prepare a short concept note and
                  then a draft MoU that outlines scope, roles, boundaries and governance. These drafts are
                  refined through feedback from relevant academic, legal, risk and ethics bodies, often
                  with an explicit AI governance lens where AI is in scope.

                  After approval and signature, collaboration moves into practice, with named coordinators,
                  clear points of contact and periodic review. Over the coming decade, many institutions may
                  increasingly treat these MoUs as living governance instruments, revisited when AI policies,
                  regulations or institutional risk appetites evolve.
