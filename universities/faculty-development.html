              Why faculty development &amp; support is central to AI governance
            </h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
              AI governance is multi-disciplinary and evolving. Faculty shape how students, professionals and
              institutions understand responsibility, risk and ethics in AI systems. Supporting faculty in this
              area is both a capacity-building and governance question for universities, especially as AI becomes
              embedded in teaching, research and institutional operations.

                  Faculty development initiatives can help colleagues connect regulatory, ethical and governance
