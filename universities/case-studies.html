            <p class="section-subtitle">
              In AI governance, responsible practice is often best understood through concrete examples:
              how institutions design policies, govern algorithms, and manage risk in real-world settings.
              Universities and institutes may therefore choose to document “pilots” and “case studies”
              to generate structured learning, while respecting ethics, confidentiality and regulatory limits.

                  Case studies allow students, faculty and practitioners to see how AI governance frameworks
                  translate into actual decisions, trade-offs and implementation steps in specific contexts
                  such as universities, courts, hospitals or companies, rather than remaining purely theoretical.
