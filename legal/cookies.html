          Over the 2020s and 2030s, expectations around cookies, telemetry and AI governance will likely continue to

          <li class="mb-1">
            Cookie and telemetry practices may need to more clearly distinguish between
            <strong>AI model improvement</strong>, <strong>user experience analytics</strong> and
            <strong>compliance monitoring</strong>, with appropriate consent and governance for each.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Organizations may adopt <strong>privacy-enhancing analytics</strong> (for example, aggregation, differential
            privacy, on-device processing) that reduce reliance on personally identifiable cookie data.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            <strong>AI-assisted navigation and personalization</strong> may rely on structured preference cookies and
            risk controls that ensure users understand what is being customized and why.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Cross-border AI governance collaborations may encourage harmonized patterns for cookie transparency and
