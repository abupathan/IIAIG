          This section is intended for websites that may integrate AI-assisted or automated features (for example,

            information.

          <li class="mb-1">
            AI-assisted tools are <strong>not a substitute</strong> for professional advice and should not be relied

          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            You remain responsible for independently evaluating AI-generated or AI-assisted content before acting on
            it, including by consulting primary sources and qualified professionals where appropriate.

          <li class="mb-1">
            We may log and process interactions with AI-assisted tools (subject to the Privacy Policy and Cookie

        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">15. Future-ready considerations for AI governance terms (non-binding)</h2>
        <p class="small text-muted">
          Over the 2020s and 2030s, AI governance expectations, sector-specific regulations and professional norms are
          likely to evolve significantly. This non-binding section provides directional considerations for how Terms of
          Use may need to adapt; it is not a commitment or legal forecast.
        </p>
        <ul class="small text-muted ps-3 mb-3">
          <li class="mb-1">
            Terms may need to reference <strong>AI incident reporting</strong> and escalation processes where online
            tools are used to support high-impact decisions or critical infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Joint interpretations of <strong>AI governance standards</strong> (public or private) may require clearer
            disclosures about what is illustrative guidance versus what is mandated by law or binding codes.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Cross-border collaboration may require coordination between multiple legal frameworks, such as data
            protection law, AI-specific regulations and professional conduct rules.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            More granular role-based disclaimers may emerge (for example, how boards, risk committees, technologists,
            auditors and educators should interpret AI governance guidance published online).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small text-muted mb-0">
          In any live deployment, organizations should review these Terms periodically to ensure that they remain aligned
          with current law, AI governance expectations and the actual ways in which the Site and related tools are used.
