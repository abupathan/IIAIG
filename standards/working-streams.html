            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Technical working streams are focused, time-bound groups that bring together practitioners from different
              disciplines to explore specific AI governance questions, develop practice materials or test implementation
              options. They typically support – but do not replace – formal governance bodies such as boards,
              committees or regulatory authorities, and their outputs are advisory and non-binding.

                  Working streams typically bring together technical, governance, risk, legal, ethics and domain
                  experts to develop shared understanding and practical approaches to AI-related questions in a
                  clearly defined area, with scope and timelines agreed upfront.

                  Streams can help translate high-level frameworks and policies into tooling decisions, data practices,
                  documentation patterns and workflows that teams can use in practice, without altering underlying
                  legal obligations or approved policies.

                  By working on concrete issues and sharing lessons learned, streams can inform updates to policies,
                  practice notes, training and tooling, while remaining clearly non-binding and subordinate to
                  formal governance decisions.

          Whether within a single institution or through professional communities, technical working streams function

              As AI systems become more capable and governance expectations become more structured, technical working
              streams may also evolve. The cards below present a neutral, forward-looking orientation – not predictions

                  Streams may feed more explicitly into “knowledge graphs” for AI governance – structured repositories
                  of patterns, examples and decision factors – helping boards, committees and teams see how similar
                  questions have been approached elsewhere, while still respecting context and confidentiality limits.

                  Without automating governance decisions, streams might increasingly produce outputs that can be linked
                  to tools – for example, machine-readable tags for control libraries, AI registries or assessment
                  workflows – while narrative guidance continues to support human judgment and oversight.
