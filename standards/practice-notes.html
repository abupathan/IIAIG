            <p class="section-subtitle">
              In many professional fields, non-binding practice materials help practitioners translate high-level
              principles and frameworks into day-to-day judgment. In AI governance, Practice Notes and Guidance Papers
              can play a similar conceptual role: they offer structured examples, decision factors and implementation
              perspectives without becoming law or regulation, and can be updated over time as AI capabilities and
              regulatory expectations evolve.

                  Practice Notes can offer worked examples, scenario discussions and practical checklists that show how
                  AI governance principles and frameworks might be applied in typical situations, while explicitly
                  acknowledging that context and applicable regulation matter and may change over the next decade.

                  questions to ask and trade-offs to document, assisting – but not replacing – professional and
                  institutional judgment, including decisions about when to seek legal or specialist advice.

                  Over time, non-binding notes can be revised to reflect new experience, regulatory developments or
                  emerging good practices, while clearly documenting their version, scope and status, and retiring or
                  consolidating older notes where appropriate.
