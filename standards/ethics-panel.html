              AI-HITL and the need for structured ethics &amp; governance dialogue
            </h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
              “Human-in-the-loop” (HITL) arrangements aim to ensure that human judgment remains central in AI-enabled
              decisions, particularly when those decisions affect people, rights or critical outcomes. An AI-HITL
              Governance &amp; Ethics Panel can provide a structured forum for reflecting on difficult cases, policy
              questions and systemic risks that arise in such contexts, including as AI capabilities and regulations
              evolve through the 2030s.

                <p class="card-text text-muted small mb-0">
                  HITL does not merely mean “click to approve.” A structured panel can help clarify what meaningful
                  human oversight should look like for different AI use cases, and how it interacts with ethics,
                  risk, legal requirements and professional duties – especially in settings where automation levels
                  may increase over time.

                  AI-HITL questions typically span product, data science, law, ethics, operations and frontline
                  practitioners (for example, teachers, clinicians, case workers). A panel offers a cross-functional
                  meeting place for these perspectives, including – where appropriate – voices for affected groups
                  and public-interest views.

                  situations can generate learning that improves policies, training and safeguards across the
                  organization – and can inform future AI governance frameworks, audits and regulatory dialogue.

                  Panels may move from focusing mainly on single cases to identifying patterns across cases –
                  recurring risk themes, structural issues in HITL design, and signals that existing policies or
